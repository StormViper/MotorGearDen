When testing with Stripe we do not allow any secrets to be stored in code or typed down.

If you need a code please contact someone else who has them written down.
These codes will be used in an export for example;-

export secret_key="Secret_key"
export publishable_key="Publishable key"

This is one of the way's we plan to keep our secrets safe.
